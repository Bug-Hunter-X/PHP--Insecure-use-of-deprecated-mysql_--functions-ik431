This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in PHP code: the use of deprecated `mysql_*` functions. These functions are not only outdated but also pose significant security risks. The provided code uses insecure query construction which makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.  The solution provides a secure alternative using prepared statements with PDO.
